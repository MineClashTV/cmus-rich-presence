v2.0.0
- Added support for custom config file locations
- Changed the way configuration parsing works, because why not
    - Automated populating the internal config map, adding more config options doesn't require changing the code of the
      ConfigurationFile source anymore
    - New parser can detect strings, booleans, and integers correctly
- Replaced my commandline argument parser for the more robust and feature-rich Apache Commons CLI library
- Made the cmus output parser more robust
    - Fixed possible wrong album tag readings when a song also has an albumartist tag
- Other minor code style improvements

v1.9.1
- Added support for comments in config file
- Added explaining comments in the default config file

v1.9
- Added a configuration file
- Added support for custom formatting!
  You can use the following placeholders:
        - %title
        - %artist
        - %date
        - %album
  There are multiple ways to use this feature:
        1.  using command-line arguments
                ```--top, -t``` "format string"
                ```--bottom, -b``` "format string"
        2.  using a configuration file
                Make sure it's called "cmusrp.conf", is in the same directory as the jar file and contains the following:
                ```
                TOP_FORMAT="format string goes here"
                BOTTOM_FORMAT="format string goes here"
                ```

v1.8
- Now shows the version string when hovering over icon
- Minor code improvements

v1.7
- Added '--quiet' argument
    - Disables all console output
- Added argument abbreviations
    - '--help': '-h'
    - '--debug': '-d'
    - '--interval': '-i'
    - '--quiet': '-q'

v1.6
- Added '--help' argument
- Untagged songs will show up a little nicer, now excluding the full path and only showing the filename without extension
- Tons of code optimizations. Big thanks to [Zom-B](https://github.com/Zom-B)

v1.5
- Added argument parsing:
    - '--debug' activates debugging mode introduced in version 1.3
    - '--interval [int]' sets polling interval in ms [default: 1000]
- Added warning for songs that are not tagged properly
- When cmus is paused, it will no longer display activity in Discord
- Removed unnecessary Logger class, just use default printf
- The usual code optimizations. It's a lot more readable now.

v1.4
- Added icon
- Code cleanups:
    - Cleaned up main loop just a little

v1.3
- Added better documentation. It may be too much though, feels like there's more comments than actual code
- Added debug mode, which disables DiscordRPC and enables verbose logging.
  May be bloat but this makes debugging without spamming my discord status easier.
- Code cleanups:
    - Fix infinite loop statement. I don't know if something bad could happen otherwise, but my IDE told me to do so.
    - Cleaned up main method

v1.2
- Added year information
- Fixed crash when song isn't tagged properly, full filename will be displayed (temporary fix)
- Removed unused code

v1.1
- Fixed album parsing

v1.0
- First release
